	- quotes
		- y'alright? Name's suvik, I tend the bar ere at the ol yawner. Ya lookin fer a drink? Or are ya headin straight for the well?
		- Secomber? Yeah, I used to live there about a year ago.  To be honest with you, place was too boring.  Nothing excitin ever happens there.  Heard about the yawning portal and it seemed the ticket.  Brought my son Bruno here with me, haven't missed it.  All kinds of excitement round here.
		- owner is a kobold named Durn.  Surly fella, but he gave me a job with no references, so he's alright in my books
		- even let's me run a side hustle.  If ya find anything magic down there ya don't mind partin with, I'll give ya a great price, if ya can get back here with it.  And I've usually got an extra trinket or two hangin around if ya got too much gold weighin ya down.  Cleaned out at the moment I'm afraid.

- **Roy Mereg**, A lawful good bard named , known as Threestrings to his friends, plays a three-stringed lute at the Yawning Portal and is a much more talented musician than he pretends to be.

	- quotes:
		- G'day.  Name's Roy, but everyone round 'ere calls my three strings, on account of my busted up lute 'ere.  Give em a few timely plucks up on that stage and it brings the ouse down

Cally provided shelter and healing to a wounded Harper spy in Skullport and is owed payment for her support. The pouch contains three moonstones worth 50 gp each.
		- Once they deliver the pouch, characters can take refuge in a Harper hideout called Dalagor's Fortress, located on the uppermost level of Skullport. Mattrim tells the characters that a dragonborn mage named Felrax guards the place.

Her family has a tarnished reputation, having once been banished from Waterdeep for slavery and other illegal acts; Though they are trying to salvage their family name. Her brother, Kressando, is in Skullport, conducting secret meetings with the Xanathar Guild to set up a slave trade in Skullport. 
	- quotes:
		- Who are you lookin at? That's right, *hic* I'm a Rosznar! Another slave driving, bribe taking, scum of faerun Rosznar.
		- I'm a saint compared to my brother, Kress. He's the real deal. There isn't a soul in waterdeep he wouldn't betray for a single gold piece. *Hic* includin me.
		- jumped into the portal lookin ta Slade more traves with the xanathar guild.
		- you're goin down there too? If you find him, tell him he's a scum suckin stirge who deserves whatever he's got comin. He wears a ring like this one
		- don't ferget, you can always trust in house reznar
	- quest:
		- she takes one or more of the adventurers aside as they prepare to make their initial descent into Undermountain and asks them to keep an eye out for Kressando. She also tells them that Kressando wears a platinum signet ring bearing the Rosznar family crest (a diving white falcon on a field of blue) and an inscription of the family motto ("Fly high and stoop swift").
		
		- She promises that if the characters can facilitate Kressando's safe return or deliver proof of his whereabouts  she will owe them a favor, adding that "You can trust in House Rosznar."
		
		- Characters won't find Kressando anywhere, but they might find his ring in the possession of a hobgoblin warlord named Azrok (see [level 3, area 21n](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#wdmm,3,21n.%20azrok's%20hall,0)) and discover how Esvele's brother met his untimely end. Returning Kressando's ring to Esvele completes the quest and places her in the party's debt.

- **Volo Geddarm**, famous explorer and raconteur, offers to buy the adventurers a round of drinks to celebrate their upcoming expedition into the Dungeon of the Mad Mage. 
	- Bonjour mon ami, and if you're leaping in ze well, bon chance! I am Volo
	- ah, so you are heading down! A round of drinks for these brave souls, Suvic! 
	- if you're interested in history, perhaps I can tell you a little story?
	- Long before waterdeep existed, this land was part of an ancient elven kingdom called illefarn. The alabaster throne of their last king disappeared from the capital city. It's said that a group of dwarves admired the miraculous work of stonecraft and stole the throne right out from under the elves' slender noses. Where the dwarves hid it for so long, who knows? But should you find it in Undermountain, it would please the elves of the North to know it survives.
	- In truth, the ancient alabaster throne was spared the destruction of Aelinthaldaar by Coronal Audark himself, who ordered it placed in an underground vault. Despite the precaution, the throne was damaged in the calamity that befell the elven kingdom. After the fall of Illefarn, Melairkyn dwarves found the throne and bore it to their halls with the intention of repairing it and returning it to the elves.
	- If the characters find the throne (see [level 3, area 14c](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#wdmm,3,14c.%20hall%20of%20stone,0)) and inform Volo of its location, he shares this information with his elf friends, who express their gratitude by giving the party a beautifully crafted longbow and an elven quiver containing twenty silvered arrows. The bow bears the Elvish inscription "_Al hond ebrath, uol tath shantar en tath lalala ol hond ebrath_." This phrase translates to "A true friend, as the trees and the water are true friends." The elves eventually embark on their own expedition into Undermountain, with the goal of retrieving the throne.
